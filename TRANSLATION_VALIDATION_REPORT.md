## Validation Methodology

Three comprehensive validation scripts were created and executed:

### 1. Structure Comparison (`compare_translations.py`)
- Extracted all key paths from each file recursively
- Compared total key counts across all languages
- Identified any missing or extra keys in each language

### 2. Namespace Analysis (`detailed_structure_report.py`)
- Analyzed each top-level namespace individually
- Counted keys within each namespace
- Identified nested namespaces
- Verified consistency across all four languages

### 3. Comprehensive Path Validation (`comprehensive_validation.py`)
- Generated complete list of all 291 translation key paths
- Verified each path exists in all four languages
- Listed all keys alphabetically for verification
